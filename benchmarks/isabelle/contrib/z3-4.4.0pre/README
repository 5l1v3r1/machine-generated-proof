This distribution of Z3 4.4.0 unstable (pre-release, revision 0482e7fe727c) was
assembled from

    https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
    http://z3.codeplex.com/releases

The Cygwin version was copied from the "bin" directory of the "Windows x86
unstable" archive "z3-4.4.0.0482e7fe727c-x86-win.zip", obtained from

    http://z3.codeplex.com/releases/view/101914

The "z3.exe" file was renamed "z3-solver.exe", and the "z3" wrapper script was
added (to convert file paths). The DLL files were set to be executable using
"chmod ugo+x".

For Linux and Mac OS X, custom binaries were built from the source code,
obtained from

    https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3

(revision 0482e7fe727c). The Linux executables were built on a 32-bit and a
64-bit Ubuntu 10.04 LTS installation running on VirtualBox VM. The Mac
executables were built on a 64-bit OS X 10.7 (Lion) server called "macbroy6".
FPA support had to be disabled on OS X to work around "duplicate symbol" linker
errors. The executables were "strip"ped.

Enjoy!
