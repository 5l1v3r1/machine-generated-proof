This distribution of CVC4 1.5 was assembled from

    http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/downloads/

The 32-bit Linux executable was built on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, with
"./configure --enable-static-binary; make" and finally "strip -s".

The 64-bit Linux and 32-bit Windows executables were taken from

    http://cvc4.cs.stanford.edu/downloads/builds/x86_64-linux-opt/cvc4-1.5-x86_64-linux-opt
    http://cvc4.cs.stanford.edu/downloads/builds/win32-opt/cvc4-1.5-win32-opt.exe

The Windows executable was renamed "cvc4-solver.exe". A "cvc4" wrapper script
is provided to interpret Cygwin paths correctly.

The Mac executables were built on a 64-bit OS X 10.9 server called "macbroy2".
The "cvc4" executables and dynamic libraries were extracted from

    builds/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0/production/src/main/.libs/cvc4
    builds/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0/production/src/.libs/libcvc4.dylib
    builds/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0/production/src/parser/.libs/libcvc4parser.dylib
    /opt/local/lib/libgmp.10.dylib

The "cvc4" binary was renamed "cvc4-solver". A "cvc4" wrapper script is
provided to set up "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" correctly. Symbolic links were created
for "libcvc4.4.dylib" and "libcvc4parser.4.dylib":

    ln -s libcvc4.dylib libcvc4.4.dylib
    ln -s libcvc4parser.dylib libcvc4parser.4.dylib

On all platforms, binary files (including scripts and libraries) were made
executable using

    chmod ugo+x *

Enjoy!
