This distribution of E 2.0 (Turzum) has been compiled according to
the "README" file included in the official version from
http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/Download.html.

    $ tar zxvf E.tgz
    $ cd E
    $ ./configure
    $ make

The Linux executables were built on 32- and 64-bit installations of Ubuntu
12.04.5 LTS running in VirtualBox. The Mac OS X executables were built on a
64-bit Mac OS X 10.7 machine called "macbroy2". The Windows executable were
built on a 64-bit virtual installation of Windows 7.

A selection of the executables in "PROVER/" were moved to the
platform-specific target directory (e.g., "x86_64-linux"). The "eproof_ram"
script was slightly modified to use the correct path. The distribution also
includes Josef Urban's "runepar.pl" script, modified to use the correct path.


Enjoy!
